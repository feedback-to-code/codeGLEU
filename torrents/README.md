Although this repo contains the code to generate all data used within my thesis, assuming all_preds.jsonl and results.json files are provided, this process may take hours or even days depending on device performance. Furthermore, the data source (github) may potentially change over time. As such, i am providing copies of my data as it was at the moment of writing via torrent.    
I may not necessarily be seeding these torrents at all times, so if you wish to download one and find it inactive, contact me and I will resume seeding.

Use a torrenting software such as 'qbittorrent' to access torrents.    
All torrents come in encrypted rar files, with a shared password 'FRITS'.  

The following torrents are available:

EvaluationData.rar: Data, scripts, environment and instructions required to run evaluation experiment.    
RankingData.rar: Data, scripts, environment and instructions required to run ranking experiment.    
MultirefData.rar: Data, scripts, environment and instructions required to run multi-ref experiment.
