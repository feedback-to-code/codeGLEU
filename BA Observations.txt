BLEU correlates poorly with resolved tests and strongly with % file unchanged
CodeBLEU correlates poorly with resolved tests and strongly with % file unchanged, but better than bleu
CodeGLEU correlates poorly with resolved tests and strongly with % file unchanged, but better than CodeGLEU

here: changes in weights / ngram weights not that significant
high penalty for dataflow match useful
dataflow match inherently less related to % file unchanged because variables are named via enumeration

New metric:
consider only diffs, then compare diff(source, reference) and diff(source, hypothesis)
Correlates alright with resolved tests (~0.5)
